# Asian option pricing examples taken from :
# Numerical Methods in Finance & Economics by Paolo Brandimarte pg 456 & 461


# TODO: asian should be cheaper than European;
# TODO: asian volatility should be lower than European
# Asian option price is sensitive to the number of sample points.
# As you increase the number of sample points the price seems to decrease
# as you're including more points at inception... this seems dubious
# Geometric Asian options are cheaper than Arithmetic ones because
# the geometric mean is less than the arithmetic mean.
